    <h2>Privacy Policy (Free Version)</h2>
    <p>This policy effective July 26, 2022</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Nothing in this policy contradicts the following statements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We don't collect any of your personal info, including your IP address, other than information you voluntarily
          provide, for example, by contacting us over email.
        </li>
        <li>
          In this situation we never sell your personal info to advertisers or other third parties.
        </li>
        <li>We share your personal info only when legally required, or when reasonably necessary to prevent harm in an
          emergency situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          We retain your personal info, excluding info you make public, for no more than 30 days after you request
          deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          As used in this policy, “Personal Info” is data that can identify a particular person or device. Aggregate data
          isn't considered Personal Info.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have never received any legal or government demands for user information.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Advertisement (free version only)</h2>
      <p>The Services may link to third-party websites, online services,
        or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third
        parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to
        other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do
        not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we
        will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of
        such third-party websites, services, or applications.</p>
        <p>
        The inclusion of a link towards a third party website, service,
        or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot
        guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third
        parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this
        privacy notice. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We are not responsible for the content or privacy
        and security practices and policies of any third parties, including
        other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or
        from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties
        and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        As explained above, we will comply with a request for user data when the law requires it, but we require valid
        legal process to compel the disclosure of user data to the government; such as a legitimate and properly scoped
        court order, or a search warrant supported by probable cause and issued by an appropriate law enforcement
        authority. We interpret requests narrowly, and we will oppose unlawful or overbroad requests for specific user
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may make small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice to you, so you're encouraged to
        review the policy from time to time.
      </p>
